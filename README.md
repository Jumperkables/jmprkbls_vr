## Steam games on VR compatible with Arch Linx

1. Follow the instructions of [this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamPlay/comments/gbdiia/playing_regular_games_in_vr_works_on_linux_finally/)
    * Boot the game
    * Indetify the window ID of the game on desktop (xwininfo)
    * `vr-video-setup --flat <window_ID>`



## Rants on Linux compatability with VR Game Development

The Unreal engine is the only Linux supported VR development framework I could find that could swiftly be started. It would be great to have access to the Source 2 engine Valve used to develop Half Life Alyx. Or at least proper access to the workshops for SteamVR and Half Life Alyx's workshops. Oh well.

### Unity
To the best of my knowledge, Unity development for SteamVR is not currently supported on Linux as of 02/09/20. So fuck that.

### Source 2
Soon, hopefully. Valve are doing good with Linux compatability and should be supported. Cheers guys <3.
